    archivos** bar and will be displayed there as shown in Figure 3.1.

## 3.2 Creating a Model 

 After loading your data, define the dependent and independent
variables to generate the regression model. This process establishes
the relationship between variables and forms the basis for
predictions.
>
**To create a model**

1.  Load the dataset following the steps in **3.1**.

2.  Choose the dependent variable (Y-axis) under **Columna de entrada**.

    After you select, the variable will be displayed.

3.  Choose the independent variable (X-axis) under **Columna de
    objetivo**.

    After you select, the variable will be displayed.

4.  Click **Procesar** to process the data.

    A pop-up notification will appear, indicating the data has been
    processed.

5.  Click **Siguiente** to generate the regression model.

    If steps were followed correctly, you will be directed Modelo
    section of the application with a model created.

6.  Select **OK.**

relationships between variables. This section explains how to interact
with the visualization features and gain deeper understanding from
data created.

## 4.1 Visualizing Models

The visualization feature displays a regression graph that helps you
analyze the relationships in your data. You can interact with the
graph to explore trends and patterns in greater detail.

**To visualizing models**
