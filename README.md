## 1. Introduction

This application is designed to assist you in creating, visualizing, saving, and loading simple and multiple linear regression models. You can work with data stored in CSV and Excel files, databases and model saved previously by the application. The application also enables you to make predictions using the trained models.


## 2. Getting Started

### 2.1 System Requirements

This is a web application, so there is no need for an internal installation on your computer. 
However, if you want to browse and open the application, you must have an integrated development environment installed on your computer and the necessary libraries to be able to run the corresponding programs.

### 2.2 Installation<a name="installation"></a>

To install the following libraries, you must execute this command in the development environment terminal [pip install 'library'].

- Streamlit
- Pandas
- sklearn
- Matplotlib

## 3. User Interface

### 3.1 Main Interface

The main interface consists of a left sidebar where you can access all functions offered by the application and a content area in which the information related to the functions performed is displayed.

### 3.2 Variable Selection

To analyze your data effectively, follow these steps:

1. **Load a File:** [Instructions for Loading a File - Refer to Section 4.1]
2. **Select Variables:** [Instructions for Selecting Variables - Refer to Section 4.2]

### 3.3 Model Creation and Visualization

Create a predictive model using the selected variables:

1. **Model Creation and Visualization:** [Instructions for Model Creation - Refer to Section 4.3]

### 3.4 Save and Load Models

After creating a model, you can save it for future use. To do this:

1. In the left sidebar, click on "Download Model."
2. Choose a location to save the model file.
3. To load a previously saved model:
   - Click on "Load Model" in the left sidebar.
   - Navigate to the location of the saved model file.
   - Select the file and click "Open."

## 4. Usage Instructions

### 4.1 Loading a File

5. Display of the first data of the file in the content area.

### 4.2 Selecting Variables

1. After loading a file, go to the left sidebar.
2. Click on "Variable Selection."
3. Choose the variables of interest from the available options.

### 4.3 Model Creation and Prediction

1. With variables selected, go to the left sidebar.
2. Click on "Model Creation and Visualization."
3. Display of prediction operation in left sidebar.
4. Display of the regression graphs display.
5. Once the model is created, you can use it to make predictions.

### 4.4 Saving and Loading Models

1. After creating a model, click on "Save Model" to save it for future use.
2. To load a saved model, click on "Load Model" and select the appropriate file.
